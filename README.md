# Sequence Learner
 Sequnce Learner implements the idea of one shot sequence learning using generative hebbian style learning . Core cocept is similar to Numentas HTM temproral learner but we have a different implementation ,rather than being biological correct ,we tried to have biological inspired implementation .
Learner more of tries to do memorization of sequnces like humans do .

for proof of concept there is multipication table memorization in run_tests.py .

Idea works for building word embeddings ,language modelling as well but those learners are not added here .
